### How it was made

This application was made using Ruby, Ruby On Rails, API call, erb, css, 

## Lessons learned

I learned that Statelessness is when the server does not store any information about the client, and every request must contain all the necessary details to complete. It taught me to better understand that whatever information is needed for this api call is handled by the client and submitted every time.
